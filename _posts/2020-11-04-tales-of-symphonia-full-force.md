It's been a while! I've been extremely busy lately. Some, but not all, of my time has
gone into helping VGM CON with their Side Quest event, which was a lot of fun! Life
hasn't all been fun and games, but that event was a great time!

Today's tune is another *Tales of Symphonia* masterpiece by Motoi Sakuraba. "Full Force"
is the game's first battle theme, played as the protagonists travel through the land of
Sylvarant. Its quick intro is a callback to a similar introduction to *Tales of
Phantasia*'s main battle theme, "Take Up the Cross", but played twice as fast. After
that, the theme's four sections alternate between C minor and A minor.

The C minor sections are more intense, with syncopated chord changes and some changes
that happen on the half note instead of on the whole note. Additionally, both sections
have an unusual number of measures (18 and 14), which adds to the tension and keeps the
listener on their toes. The A minor sections are more regular, with less frequent chord
changes and an even 16 measures in each section. These sections allow the listener to
relax a little, but the respite is only temporary; after sixteen measures, the C minor
sections abruptly return. This theme serves as a great example of how to control and
balance the tension throughout a piece.
