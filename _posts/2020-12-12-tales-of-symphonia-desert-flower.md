I hope you're not sick of *Tales of Symphonia* yet! This tune, "Desert Flower", plays in
the sleepy desert town of Triet. It's the perfect song for relaxing after a grueling
battle in the Triet Desert against those accursed snakes...

This song sounds pretty simple, but when you take a closer listen, you can hear deeper
harmonies with chord extensions. The melody in the [A] section is nice, starting off
with some dancing around the major third of the tonic chord (C# for A major), but it
pivots into a phrase that hits C natural and G natural pretty hard, to subvert the
question and answer of the first melodic phrase. The [B] section is a solo carried by...
I have no idea what instrument that is actually. I had a hell of a time trying to
transcribe the melody here. What I've come up with is close enough, and interested
listeners can feel free to take a crack at it themselves. After the solo concludes, it's
a simple pivot back to the top of the chart.
