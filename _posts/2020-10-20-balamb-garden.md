*Final Fantasy VII* may have been my first Final Fantasy game, but *Final Fantasy VIII*
is the first Final Fantasy game I really loved. (Don't worry, pitchfork wielders, I came
around and learned to enjoy *Final Fantasy VII* later!)

One of my favorite things to do in *Final Fantasy VIII* is just sit in Balamb Garden and
listen to this theme. It's super relaxing; even now I sometimes listen to this tune if
I'm having a bad day and need to calm down. The chords are pretty simple, but the melody
tends to emphasize major sevenths and augmented fourths to brighten the tune slightly.
These melodic techniques on top of sustained strings give the listener the sense that
they are standing in a truly special place of education. I don't think this theme is
heard nearly as much after the first disc, which fits very well with the story.

There are a few measures which I chose to leave as full measure rests. I'm not really
sure if that was the right decision, but I didn't really know what I should call out on
the lead sheet in the absence of a melody. I'm also not really sure that the [A] section
is even a proper melody either, but I thought it was important to note because of the
leading major seventh tones I mentioned earlier. There might be better ways to write a
lead sheet for this tune, but I've accepted what I've come up with here. And, who knows,
maybe I'll find a way to improve it later.
