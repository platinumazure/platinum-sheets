A couple of years ago, I was looking for a specific type of JRPG. I was getting a little
sick of the games that try to impress the player right off the bat with a large-scale
world map and story, and I wanted to play something that started small and expanded the
scope only gradually. I eventually found this in *The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the
Sky*.

A great example of this in an older game is *Final Fantasy VII*. The game feels plenty
big just looking at the Midgar sectors, and (without spoiling anything) the player is
led to think that they need to complete a specific objective associated with each sector.
But it doesn't take long before that starts to be deconstructed, and after a series of
events, the group is outside Midgar and the world gets much bigger. The story also starts
to expand at this point, as the party receives an explanation about the protagonist's
reactions earlier which reveals the main villain of the story. Even this exposition dump
happens as the group visits the next couple of towns, rather than all at once. In this
way, *Final Fantasy VII* starts with a moderate size world (the massive city of Midgar)
and then expands its world and story a few hours in.

By contrast, games like *Final Fantasy XV* try to impress the player with a large world
map right away. It's possible to reveal the first quarter of the world map just by doing
all the side quests available from the car shop that the group visits after the prologue.
Most of these quests are tedious fetch or kill quests that require spending a fair amount
of time in the party's car, sort of like sailing in *Zelda: The Wind Waker*. This
approach to exposition only highlights how empty the world feels and how much padding has
been put in through the map design. I think it makes a lot of sense to limit the player's
access early on, as long as what the game provides in those early sections is
sufficiently interesting and has plenty of hooks for new and ongoing plot threads.

I eventually heard about *The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky* and bought it on a
whim. It didn't take long for me to realize that this was exactly what I wanted. The game
starts off in a small town and there's enough to do and talk about there. Before long,
the protagonists join the "bracer guild", which is basically a group of mercenaries that
can help solve all kinds of problems when the town watch or military cannot. New bracers
are expected to travel around the country, stop in each town's bracer guild branch, and
help out the local townsfolk to earn an endoresement from that branch. So, we already 
know that the protagonists have to travel, but they will travel at a slow enough pace
that the world can be developed organically.

When the protagonists have to travel outside of the towns (whether to complete a task at
a nearby farm or cave, or to travel to the next larger town), we get to hear this theme:
"The Way They Walk in Liberl". It's got a great melody and development of ideas, but I
have to give a shout-out to Falcom Sound Team for the voicing. Great use of horn, flute,
and strings allows the same melodic ideas to be repeated without the tune feeling boring
at any point. Additionally, the second half of the piece has a different key and a new
rhythmic feel (notes are longer, almost implying a half-note pulse). The slower feeling
gives way to a brisker section that ends up being the climax of the piece. The percussion
really helps build up the tension here, first by introducing an eighth-note pulse on
snare drum, and then building up to crash cymbals accenting the syncopated hits.

In this transcription, there were a couple of things I wish I could have improved. For
example, the [C] section is exactly the same as the [A] section, except for the last
three notes that are pickups into the [D] section. I thought about using first and
second ending voltas, but having the entire [B] section in a first ending didn't seem
like a good idea. I could have done a D.S. al Coda, but that would have been a little
harder to read and I don't know if I would have saved more than one system. In the end,
I decided to just repeat the section after all. If you have any ideas on how the
engraving could be improved without sacrificing readability, I would love to hear it.
