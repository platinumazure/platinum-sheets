I could write a few paragraphs about this song having such an impact on me when I first
played this game, but, well, that would be a lie. I mostly wrote this sheet up as a very
quick exercise, and then I decided to use this to test out the new functionality for
rendering multiple parts.

Also, I have seen like four different names for this song. And I'm too lazy to change
either the post title or the lead sheet title. If you have an issue with that, you can
bite me. :smile:

If anyone is curious why the C part and the Vocals part have their notes in different
octaves, the reason is that most C instruments can play the higher notes more easily
(and many lower instruments still conventionally read music in that octave range), but
the singing in the game is definitely more alto range. I'm sure there are other ways the
parts could have been engraved, but this does feel consistent to me.
