Sometimes, video game music is complex and has a strict form, making songs elegant and
classy. Other times, video game music is just plain *fun*. Today's tune is a romp from
*Final Fantasy IX*, the theme of Quina Quen.

"Quina's Theme" has a really primal feel to it, with a lot of tribal-style drumming and
simple choral melodies. There isn't much harmony to speak of, and bands could probably
freely interpret how and when to add harmony and when to let the rhythm carry the tune
forward. This transcription chooses to note harmony when the piano hits a chord and when
the choir is singing, more by convention than because that is actually where rhythm
sections should always hit chords. It might not be exactly how other people would have
transcribed it, but this tune is so much fun to listen to and play and I wanted to get it
out on my blog. :smile:
