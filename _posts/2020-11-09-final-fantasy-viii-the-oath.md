*Final Fantasy VIII* has a very divided fanbase. Many people panned it when it came out,
expecting something like *Final Fantasy VII* only better. But *Final Fantasy VIII* is a
different game, not necessarily better or worse.

One of the reasons why this game is one of my very favorite games, however, was this
moment near the end of Disk 2. Squall Leonhart's home is in a precarious situation,
literally at war with another country. The first few skirmishes have been exhausting and
demoralizing, and the good guys have to make a last, desperate attack, or else face total
defeat. After spending most of Disk 2 strongly resisting the chains of commanding, Squall
finally understands that he needs to step up. And after an awkward start, he somehow hits
it out of the park. All the while, we hear "The Oath" in the background, helping to
forever engrave this scene into my memory.

I'm definitely not sure about a lot of these chords, but they sound basically correct to
me. There's definitely some color and complexity, and a lot of suspensions and
resolutions. The mood keeps changing because of all of the chords that don't follow the
key (e.g., F major chord at the second system, pivoting between A major and A minor).
The whole thing is extremely powerful, and I tried really hard to do justice to the
genius of this theme.

This is what Squall says in that pivotal scene:

> ...Everybody, this is Squall. How's everyone doing? You're all probably too tired to
> even stand up after all the fighting. But I want everyone to listen to me...
> 
> We still have a chance to win, and I need your help. This is going to be our final
> battle. We're going to attack them before they come in again. To do that, we're going
> to head straight into their Garden. So I want everyone to prepare for a major
> collision. Take care of all the junior classmen. Irvine, Quistis, Zell and Selphie
> will lead the attack into their Garden. As for everyone else, please support them if
> you can.
> 
> SeeD was formed to fight the sorceress, at least, that's what I heard. And Garden was
> created to train SeeDs. So this battle is Garden's destiny and also our destiny. It's a
> grueling battle, and I'm sure you guys are all exhausted. But I don't want to have any
> regrets. I don't want anyone to look back and regret this day. So just this once, I
> want you guys to give everything you've got! For yourselves, and for me!
