title: So What Is All This, Anyway?
---
Between my existing depression and the stifling nature of pandemic life, I feel like I've
been drifting aimlessly through life for a while. I think I had probably been drifting
since at least 2012, the year I almost got married. I was probably beating myself up
throughout those intervening years about my perceived failure to get married, start a
family, and bring my parents the joy of grandchildren. It probably strengthened my
depression significantly, but I'm not really sure.

Things came to a head not long after the year started (before the pandemic, even).
Although I had been seeing a therapist since 2019, I didn't realize how badly I needed
help until that day in January. In late 2019 and early 2020, I joined a VGM community and
was really eager to help out. I contributed a lot, but it didn't last. After all the
effort I had put in trying to contribute to that community, they took issue with my
energy and passion and, rather than trying to help me direct it in a healthy way, they
threw me out. I felt like I had lost everything, and I wasn't sure what to do. I held
out hope that I could maybe apologize to them for my part in things when they came to my
hometown for a convention a couple of months later, but they were unreceptive and awkward
as hell and it felt like there was nothing I could do. I felt really hopeless.

Well, throughout the rest of the year, I *sort of* moved on. It took me a while, but I've
at least given up on rejoining that group. From a slightly selfish point of view, they
didn't deserve to have me if I couldn't be sure they would handle issues more fairly
next time. And of course, they wouldn't want me back until they knew I had gotten help
and changed how I interacted with them.

For a while, I flirted with the idea of trying to get this group to interact with me in
a controlled context, to try to show them that I'm in a better place. But I realize now
how foolish this is. Who am I kidding, really? I may feel like I am seeing more color in
the world than I had been, and I may feel like I have distracted myself a little more
effectively during some of my recent spirals. But at the same time, I'm acutely aware
that this could be temporary. With just one bad day, I could regress to where I was.
I don't feel like I am beating this illness, and if I think I can convince anyone
otherwise, I am only fooling myself.

So what is all this, anyway? Well, originally, I was thinking of all these VGM
transcriptions I have lying around. Wouldn't it be cool to publish them? That was the
original plan, anyway. It took a few days of hard work, but I learned Jekyll and GitHub
Pages and put this together, and Platinum Sheets was born. You should see how I put
together the sheet post layout. The fetching of sheet music images is automatic, and
everything is intelligently filtered and sorted before rendering. If a post is related
to a sheet, only that sheet's pages are rendered on the page, and all I have to do is
include part of the sheet's file name in the front matter of the post. It's pretty cool!

But as I wrote the first few posts, I realized that what I enjoyed the most was the
opportunity to walk down memory lane and remember why I wanted to transcribe VGM in the
first place. It's because of how the music moved my heart all throughout my life. The
joy I feel in putting this together isn't from the awesome coding, but rather from the
chance to explore my childhood and formative years once more. I write these posts
partially in case anyone else might enjoy my reminiscenses, but if I'm really being
honest... it's for me. I listen to these tunes, transcribe them, write a reflection, and
post them here because these are my experiences, and I am reclaiming them as my own.

This had started out as a transcription repository, and that will still be the case to
some degree. If that VGM community sees this, hopefully they can feel relieved that I've
found my own way to get my transcriptions out there, because it means I have no reason
to approach them about rejoining their community. But this is starting to look like a
blog as well. Like the sheet music, the blog is also intended for me, as a way to express
myself and try to feel like there is some meaning to what I've gone through.

I'll be honest: I don't know how this will evolve further. But if you're here, you might as well kick back, relax, and get to know me. There are worse ways to spend your time, I
can promise you that.
