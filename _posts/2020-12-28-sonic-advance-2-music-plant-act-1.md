*Sonic Advance 2* was a great game with nonstop action and a truly excellent soundtrack.
One of the more memorable levels in this game is "Music Plant Zone", a psychedelic area
that takes Sonic through a land of musical instruments a-plenty. Sonic bounces around on
cymbals, piano keys, and much more, all accompanied by this run-filled, syncopated track.

This lead sheet was a little harder to finalize, because all of the runs (with many
accidentals) resulted in measures that would not compress horizontally at all. For a long
time, I had one system bleeding over to the second page. Nothing I tried worked, until I
reduced the minimum system distance by two spaces. As a result, the sheet feels fairly
compressed, but all of the content fits on one page now.
