I had mentioned in [an earlier post]({{ windy_valley_url | relative_url }}) that one of
the things I enjoyed the most about *Sonic Adventure* was the field exploration.

In this sheet, I've attempted to capture one of the things I enjoyed the most about said
field exploration, which is the Station Square theme. The melody is engaging, with a lot
of cool accidentals to spice things up and keep changing the mood (occasionally
accompanied by chords that help change the mood as well). And the horn section keeps
the tune fresh in the [C] section before the guitar comes back in to echo the [B]
section and bring everything home.

For the most part, I chose to leave the guitar as the melody line, even when the horns
were taking over. The only exception was going into the [C] section, where I thought the
horn crescendo was really important to capture. I definitely could have added more staves
to provide more information, but it seemed unnecessary at this point.
