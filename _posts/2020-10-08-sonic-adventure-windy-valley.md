I discovered Sonic Adveneture really late, since I didn't grow up with any Sega game
systems. I played Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on Nintendo GameCube, and then played Sonic
Adventure DX when it came out later. I remember loving the field exploration of Station
Square, Mystic Ruins, and the Egg Carrier the first time I played this game. Otherwise,
Sonic Adventure 2 feels like a much better game, and it was kind of unfortunate I played
it first.

That said, one of the stand-out features of both games is the music. Jun Senoue's guitar
lines are always awesome, whether they are part of a driving or chill tune. Today's
transcription comes from the Windy Valley level. I think more people think of The Air,
which is the last section of Sonic's Windy Valley and the only section Tails plays. But
for some reason, I like the Windy Hill music better.

Windy Hill starts with a chill vibe, courtesy of the pitched percussion. I'm not even
sure what the other melodic instrument is, maybe a harmonica? And the guitar just sits
underneath, chilling out, but you can hear some interesting chord extensions if you
listen closely. I tried to capture those in my transcription, but I will admit that my
ability to hear chord extensions is not all that great. If you have any feedback, feel
free to contact me by opening an issue on GitHub or emailing me!
