Although I had a Nintendo 64 growing up, I never owned this game. I played *F-Zero GX* on
my GameCube, and I eventually discovered this game in college and played it.

I was impressed by the stark contrast between the soundtracks for *F-Zero X* and *F-Zero
GX*. *F-Zero GX* has a lot of techno and trance elements in its soundtrack, but *F-Zero
X* tunes are mostly metal or hard rock. I enjoyed the original *F-Zero X* soundtrack, but
I have to give a shout-out to the *F-Zero X Guitar Arrange* album, which took everything
that was awesome about the original soundtrack and turned it up to eleven. That album has
helped me get through many long or depressing days.

"Drivin' Through on Max" is one of the more melodic track themes. The rhythm is pretty
straightforward for the most part, and the melody itself is not difficult. In the
original tune, the melody is played by a clean overdrive guitar. The rhythm guitar is
a little more distorted and is mostly playing a double of the bass line.

I had to employ some artistic license with the chord transcriptions. I do hear the synth
occasionally throwing in some thirds, but the rhythm guitar is much more prominent and I
didn't hear thirds in those chords. So, I made the decision to write power chord notation
in most cases and allow bands to figure out how much they want to add on top of it.

The chords are mostly power chords on I5, bVI5, and bVII5, with a surprising major V
thrown in at the end to keep the listener on their toes. I find it interesting that the
melody plays a high D natural even though the bass and inner voices are clearly hitting
the D sharp (major 3rd of the B chord). It doesn't add too much tension since the melody
is nearly two octaves above the rhythm guitar. Really interesting composition decision,
and I think it works really well.
