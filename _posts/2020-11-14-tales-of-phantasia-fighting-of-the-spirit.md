This piece is another one of my earlier transcriptions. *Tales of Symphonia* basically
changed my life, it was such a good RPG. Then I decided to play the game that started
this famous series, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear "Fighting of the Spirit" in
*Tales of Phantasia* as well!

Not too much else to say here, honestly. This theme is perfect for throwdowns with the
mighty Summon Spirits, with a driving rhythm emphasized by the relentless snare drum and
highly syncopated melody. There are minor differences between the renditions in the two
games; I actually like the *Tales of Phantasia* version a little better because it never
lets up (the one in *Tales of Symphonia* has a few sections where the rhythm eases back
a little bit). All in all, this was a fun one to transcribe.
