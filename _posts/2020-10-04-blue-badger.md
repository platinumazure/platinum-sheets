In today's post, I want to share a very simple theme from *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney*.
This is the Blue Badger theme! It's cute enough when you first hear it in the "Rise from
the Ashes" case, but it can really get stuck in your head during the courtroom scenes
when investigating critical pieces of evidence.

By the way, have you played *Ace Attorney Investigations*? This theme makes a cameo in
that game as well, but it's a much more epic march! Maybe I'll transcribe that later...
