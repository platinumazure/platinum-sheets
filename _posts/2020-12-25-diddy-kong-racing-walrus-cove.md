Winter levels are a common staple in many genres of video games. From the cool cool
mountains to snowy hamlets like Flanoir, snowy areas just stay with us.

One of my favorite wintery areas is Snowflake Mountain from *Diddy Kong Racing*. The four
racetracks in this hub world and three accompanying themes are all fantastic. My top tune
has to be "Walrus Cove"; I'm not sure why I liked it as a kid, but these days, I enjoy
the fun bass line, the interesting chords (including a few progressions from triad to
augmented to sixth to seventh), and the three varied and wonderful melodies.

Merry Christmas!
