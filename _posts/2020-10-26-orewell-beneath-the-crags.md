All of the music in *Octopath Traveler* is fantastic. "Orewell, Beneath the Crags" is
probably one of the more forgettable tunes in the soundtrack, but it does a wonderful job
of capturing the feeling of standing in the village of Orewell: high in the mountains,
but surrounded by even taller cliffsides, you really get a feeling of complete isolation
from everything else. The voicing is very sparse with just an acoustic guitar and two
recorders. There's no need for complicated harmonies in this song, because the recorder
sound is naturally melancholy and the guitar fingering is more than enough to drive the
rhythm. Sometimes simplest is best!

There isn't much to say about the engraving here, since this is about as simple as it
gets. There were a couple of times where I wasn't sure whether to note a relative major
or minor, so I hope I got those right; it was a bit hard to tell with the sparse guitar.
