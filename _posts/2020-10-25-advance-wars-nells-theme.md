I was introduced to *Advance Wars* in high school by my neighbor at the time. I thought
it looked cool, but I never really got into the game. I tried *Advance Wars: Black Hole
Rising* as well but couldn't get into that one either. I finally stuck with *Advance
Wars: Dual Strike* and beat that game's campaign. I liked the aesthetic a lot, but I just
wasn't very good at strategy games.

All of the allied CO (Commanding Officer) themes are a jam. This one is "Nell's Theme",
heard during the tutorial in the earlier cames as Nell is your CO. It is pretty simple
and unassuming for the most part, sticking to A mixolydian for the [A] section but
throwing in a few G-sharps in the [B] section. The harmony finally changes in the [C]
section bouncing between IV and V chords, with some bVII and even a major VI for spice.
Those colorful changes only tease the listener for a moment, though, before the tune
reverts back to its simple rhythm and progression as it repeats from the beginning.
