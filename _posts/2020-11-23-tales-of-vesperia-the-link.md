One of the main reasons I love *Tales of Vesperia* is its wonderful cast of characters.
Each of the protagonists is a delight on their own, but their relationships shine
especially bright in the telling of the story. Many of the moments that stand out to me
the most are those involving the development of Yuri's and Estelle's friendship, almost
all of which are accompanied by "The Link". Yuri and Estelle become really close friends,
maybe even as close as brother and sister, but there is no romantic subtext between them
and I find it quite refreshing.

This theme is pretty simple, with just two sections. The [A] section starts with the
tonic chord (with a 9th for just a little tension at the beginning), then moves in fifths
until it lands on the relative minor (G minor). After pivoting to the IV, I, and V, the
tune defies the obvious resolution and lands on an Eb major to lead into the G minor at
the start of the [B] section. The [B] section melody is carried by an oboe, and it
features a little more movement in the melody line than the previous section did.
Harmonically, the [B] section is much simpler, with vi-V-IV progressions that eventually
set up a ii-V-I at the loop. It's really interesting that neither section truly resolves;
if a band wants to play this theme, they will need to resolve to a Bb major on their own.
