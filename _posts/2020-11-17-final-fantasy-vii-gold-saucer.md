There are a lot of good tunes in *Final Fantasy VII*, but it's hard to think of a more
persistent earworm than "Gold Saucer". I think there are a couple of reasons "Gold
Saucer" sticks with the listener, the most obvious being the voicing and the overly
joyful melody. However, I think another, more subtle reason is the irregular form at the
end of the [B] section: The first two measures of the [C] section could easily fit in
with the rest of the [B] section, and on a first listen, you don't realize that you're
in a new section until you're well into it. This deviation from a typical form with
8-measure sections disorients the listener a little without them consciously noticing,
which fits extremely well with the casino setting.
