*Tales of Vesperia* was not my first *Tales* game, but it is definitely one of my
favorites. Two things stood out to me as I played the game. First, the setting and
interface combined to emphasize that humans traveled only rarely outside the cities
protected by magical barriers which repelled monsters; as a result, no one has actually
mapped the wider world, and the world map is filled with mist until you explore it
yourself as a player. And second, this game felt like one of the first *Tales* games to
throw a lot of optional bosses into the world; in *Tales of Vesperia*, these are known
as Giganto Monsters. "A Formidable Foe Stands in the Way" is the battle theme whenever
you encounter a Giganto Monster.

This theme, like many of Sakuraba-san's battle themes, starts off with progressions based
on i/bVII/bVI patterns and throws in the occasional major V. But it then pivots from A
minor into E minor and G minor in the middle sections. In the [D] section, the tune is
in A minor again but emphasizes subdominant and dominant chords (bVI and bVII) to keep
the tension up. The climax comes in the [E] section with a nonstop melody line that
explodes into a high-energy internal pedal figure over a sustained bVI harmony. While the
listener's ears are reeling from this melodic assault, the theme does a hairpin turn
to the top of the form, and the tune begins afresh.
