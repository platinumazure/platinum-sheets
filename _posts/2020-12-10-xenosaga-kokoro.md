Although the *Xenosaga* series has had mixed reviews, I really enjoyed it the first time
I played through it. When I played Episode 1, I noticed immediately how little music it
employed outside of cutscenes. I remember being disappointed at first, but I later
realized that the minimalist approach was a holdover from *Xenogears* and that in both
games, the goal was to ensure less is more.

The result is that the music definitely has quality over quantity, and this is definitely
true in the case of the ending songs. "Kokoro", which means "heart" or "spirit" in
Japanese, plays over the credits. The first time I heard "Kokoro", I was immediately
drawn in by the complex harmony, ambient voicing, and slow buildup. (The bass comes in halfway through the first verse, and the drums don't come in until the second verse.) The
harmony uses sixth, seventh, major seventh, and other chord extensions to maintain a low
level of tension that fits with the longing reminiscence captured in the lyrics.

The verses are quiet but strong, with the voices building at the end of the verse into an explosive chorus. After the first chorus, the song immediately backs off until
the second verse; by contrast, after the second chorus, the song just keeps building,
first going into a bombastic solo section carried by Uilleann pipes, and then pushing
into the climactic bridge section. Both of these sections use a deceptive new chord
progression that sounds similar to the chorus's progression, before veering into an early
bII and going in a different direction. All of this adds up to a second half of the song
which drags the listener along, caught in a powerful current, until the end of the
bridge; at which point, the song gets abruptly quieter and more ambient again, as if
depositing the listener ashore at last.

This is the first really difficult piece I've tried to transcribe. Nearly a year later,
I am satisfied enough with it to put it out. I'm sure many of the chords could be tweaked
to reflect extensions I might have missed, but I am confident this is a pretty good and
perfectly serviceable transcription.
