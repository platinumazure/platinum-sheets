When I was much younger, I took tennis lessons. I think I was eager to take up that
particular sport because I was hoping that I would have enough endurance to run in short
bursts within the confines of the court.

As it turns out, no, I do not have the endurance required! But my love of tennis did not
go away, and I later rented *Mario Tennis 64* from Blockbuster (remember those?) and had
a blast. Oddly enough, I never bought the game when I had a Nintendo 64, but I found
other ways to enjoy it (and I definitely picked up *Mario Tennis Aces* when it came out
for Nintendo Switch).

One of the things that stuck with me was the music. My favorite tune from *Mario Tennis
64* was easily the Tie Break theme, which plays when the players have an equal number of
games and need to engage in a tiebreaker to determine the outcome of the set. The
double-time feel always got my heart pumping, and the frequent changes in key and rhythm
made me feel like the game could always turn on a dime: definitely true in a tiebreaker!
