In a previous post, I talked about how *The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky* does a
great job of layering voices in order to repeat musical ideas without being obvious about
it. This holds true in "Sophisticated Fight" (the game's main battle theme) as well.

In this sheet, I was able to condense it down to one page and use a lot of repetition
structures to make the aforementioned repetition very clear. I would recommend listening
to this tune on YouTube and follow along on the sheet. If you do that, you will see that
the tune keeps things fresh by using different voices.
