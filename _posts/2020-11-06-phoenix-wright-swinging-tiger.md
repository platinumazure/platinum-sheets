sheet: Phoenix Wright - Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations - Swinging Tiger

This is actually the first lead sheet I've ever transcribed. Blast from the past! It took
a while to port it over to my new format for this site, but it's done now.

"Swinging Tiger" is one of the many excellent character themes composed by Noriyuki
Iwadare for the *Ace Attorney* series. It fits the character of Furio Tigre well: snazzy
saxophone alternates with tremendous trumpet hits, representing Don Tigre's confidence
and ability to intimidate. The [C] section is inspired by a lot of classic dorian jazz,
with chords alternating between G minor 7th and C 7th (implying the E natural dorian
tone). Overall, it's got a fun swing feel to it and is a joy to hear.
