I remember when I discovered the Ace Attorney series in college. The characters are
pretty engaging, the writing is good (especially the localization to English, phenomenal
job to that team!), but most of all, there's just something awesome about using your
wits and logic to stick it to the justice system when they arrest the wrong person.

This theme is surprisingly musically complex, compared to the character associated with
it, anyway. The time signature changes frequently in the [A] section with quick 2/4 hits,
and the chords sound like i/bVI/bVII until you hear the subtlest chord extensions. I'm
not sure I got all of the extensions, but this should be a decent sheet to work with if
you want to pay tribute to the detective who can do it when it counts.
